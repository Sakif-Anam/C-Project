# C-Project
This project is a simple calculator program written in the C programming language 💻. It allows the user to perform basic arithmetic operations such as ➕ addition, ➖ subtraction, ✖️ multiplication, and ➗ division between two numbers. The program takes two numerical inputs 🔢 and one operator (+, -, *, or /) from the user, performs the selected operation, and displays the result 🧾 in a neatly formatted way.

Designed as a 🎓 beginner-friendly project, it helps new programmers understand the fundamentals of input/output, conditional statements, and arithmetic operations in C. The program uses printf() and scanf() for user interaction 🧠 and applies if-else conditions to determine which operation to perform. It also includes simple formatting for better readability and an error message ⚠️ if the user enters an invalid operator.

To run the program, 💾 save it as calculator.c, then compile it using the GCC compiler with the command gcc calculator.c -o calculator, and execute it by running ./calculator in your terminal. For example, if you input 10, then *, and then 5, the program will output the product of those two numbers ✨ along with a clear separator line for readability.

This project reinforces key programming concepts such as 👨‍💻 user input handling, 📏 data types, 🧩 formatted printing, and 🔍 logical conditions. It can be easily extended by adding more operations like modulus (%) or exponentiation (^), improving error handling (such as checking for division by zero 🚫), or replacing the if-else statements with a switch structure.

Created by Sakif Anam 🧑‍💻, this was my first C programming project, marking the beginning of my learning journey 🌱 in software development. It’s a small but important step toward understanding how computers process user input and execute logical operations ⚙️.

🧡 “Every great developer was once a beginner who didn’t give up.” 💪
